# Introduction

Crosstalks between post-translational modifications have been widely explored. Notably, for ADP-ribosylation involved in DNA repair and ubiquitination pivoted in protein degradation and signal transduction, complex interplays are established such as Ub42R ADP-ribosylation (found in bacteria Legionella) and ADP-ribose ubiquitination. ADP-ribose ubiquitination is introduced by DELTEX E3 ligase *in vitro* but no evidence of this composite modification is found in cell. It is attributed to the lack of mass spectrometry methodologies to probe the ADPr-Ub modification in high sensitivity.

# This work

The article first demonstrated the inability of current sample procedure to detect ADPr-Ub modification. Then they established a strategy to probe cellular ADPr-Ub sites. By using ZUD domain of RNF114, which could bind ADP-Ub modification, they optimized the mass spectrometry sample preparation procedure and detect ADPr-Ub sites.

In general, ADPr-Ub modified proteins are enriched in ZUD beads, and no basic condition in sample preparation due to lability of oxyester bond in ADPr-Ub. Then the sample was processed in two different mass spectrometry, ETD and HCD. In ETD, ADPr-Ub is not fragmented, integrated ion peaks are detected, to probe the exact modification site on peptide fragments. In HCD, a more intensive condition, the ADPr-Ub is fragmented to produce characteristic peaks account for ADPr-Ub modification such as ADP-GG and AMP-GG. PARP1 and H3, H2B were found substrates for ADPr-Ub modification in cell.

In addition, the article engineered a ZUD-HRP conjugate to visualize cellular ADPr-Ub modification in immunoblotting. They succeeded in visualize H3 ADPr-Ub and PARP1 ADPr-Ub modification. In summary, the article established a robust strategy to verify ADPr-Ub modification sites in cell. However, the biological importance of ADPr-Ub is still under explored. Hitherto, little is known about how ADPr-Ub modification work in cells.
