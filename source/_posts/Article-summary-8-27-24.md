# Introduction

To respond DNA strand break, PARP1 and its paralogue PARP2 assemble at chromatin and ADP-ribosylate (ADPr) histones. PARP-mediated histone ADPr relies on cofactor HPF1, which switches PARP1 residue preference from Glu/Asp to Ser. ADPr chromatin then recruits downstream effectors to promote DNA repair pathway. However, the mechanism of PARP enzyme recognizing chromatin DNA breaks remains elusive.
